# Exercise 2 - Build a Reusable Extension as Partner

In this exercise, you wrap the extension content that you have created in a reusable extension package.  This package can then used by other customers of the same SaaS application.

## Packaging

```sh
npm pack
```

## Publishing

### Locally

Move the `tgz` file to ...

### Via NPM (optional)

```sh
npm publish
```

### Via Marketplace (outlook)


## Summary

You've now packaged and published your work to a place where it can be found by other customers.

In the next [exercise 3](../ex3/README.md), you will see how such a package can be embedded again into an application.
